# Network Intrusion Detection System using Machine Learning

# Overview:

Developed a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) capable of detecting novel attacks and effectively handling imbalanced network traffic using advanced machine learning techniques

# Features:

• Detects cyberattacks in imbalanced network traffic using Machine learning and Deep learning models

• Uses SMOTE to handle class imbalance and improve minority class detection

• Applies BERT Transformer embeddings for deep feature extraction from network data

• Trains multiple models including Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, MLP, and CNN

• Includes a Django based web interface to visualize attack predictions

# Results:

• Achieved over 99% accuracy on validation and test data

• Demonstrated high precision and recall on unseen traffic samples

# Tools & Technologies:

Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Django
